# basicCanvasGame

A mini game made in react with canvas.

I haven't made a correct structure but will continue to update this app in the future.

I always wanted to make a game but didn't know how to do it. So I followed a tutorial to understand the basics of a mini game.

you can find the demonstration via this url: https://arnaud-vanderschriek.github.io/basicCanvasGame/
